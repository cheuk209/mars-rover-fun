## Installing dependencies
To get started, use the commands from the Makefile to:
1. set up virtual environment `make venv`
2. install dependencies `make setup`
3. run tests `make test`

## Run src file directly
... or alternatively, you can run my python file directly
`python3 src/mission.py`

included in the file are the example input from the task. 

I have affirmed the results are correct and as expected.
